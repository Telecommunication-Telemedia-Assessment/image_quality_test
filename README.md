# Image Quality Test for higher resolutions

This repo contains the code to reproduce the images used for the lab and online test for image quality.
The overall idea is to evaluate H.265 for image compression.

## Structure

* images: source images and sampling procedure
* test_1: analysis of the lab test
* test_2: analysis of the online/crowd test
